  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed, dramatic atmospheric lighting, Modern Anime style, 9:16 vertical orientation. A moody scene of a determined young male street vendor standing under a large, glowing orange umbrella during a heavy downpour at night. He is wearing a grey hoodie and a dark apron, grilling four ears of sweet corn (yakitomorokoshi) on a sizzling charcoal grill. Warm light illuminates the steam and rain. Reflective wet street, blurry background pedestrians with umbrellas, neon signs for 'Ramen' and 'Takoyaki' visible in the distance. Rain streaks, cinematic composition, depth of field.",
