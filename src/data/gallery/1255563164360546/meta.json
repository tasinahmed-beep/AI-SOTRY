  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed, photorealistic cinematic photograph of a solitary fisherman standing on a large mossy rock, casting a spinning rod over a vast, still mountain lake at dawn. The fisherman wears a khaki jacket and a conical straw hat, silhouetted against a brilliant sunrise horizon featuring vibrant atmospheric gradients of orange, gold, purple, and blue. Low fog and mist cling to the dark, rolling mountains in the distance. A small dinghy boat with an outboard motor floats moored nearby. Perfect detailed reflections on the calm water surface. Golden hour lighting, high contrast, extreme clarity, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
