  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, detailed illustration, 2D anime style, cinematic lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio. A friendly, modern white humanoid robot with a rounded head and a smiling blue digital screen face stands in a sunlit art studio. The robot is gently holding a futuristic watering can, watering a lush collection of potted houseplants, including large Monstera leaves and ferns. Bright, dramatic sunlight streams through a large grid window on the left, casting sharp shadows and dust motes. On the wall, a glowing circular neon sign reads \"GREEN THUMB BOTS\" in vibrant green and blue light. An orange tabby cat sleeps peacefully on a small rug near the robot's feet. The studio is cluttered with an easel holding an abstract painting, scattered art supplies, and a bookshelf in the background. High detail, cozy atmosphere.",
