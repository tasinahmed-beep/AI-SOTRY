  "title": "Street Corn Serenade on a Rainy Night",
  "prompt": "(masterpiece), highly detailed 3D render, cinematic lighting, a cheerful, chubby street vendor wearing a yellow apron grilling several cobs of corn on a small wheeled charcoal cart. The scene is set on a wet, cobblestone city street during a heavy rainstorm at night. The vendor is sheltered by a massive red umbrella strung with warm fairy lights. Several adorable, round-faced customers stand nearby under their own umbrellas, watching the steaming grill intently. Volumetric steam and rain effects, strong reflections on the wet ground. Pixar Style animation, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
