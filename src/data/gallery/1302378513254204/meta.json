  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), 2D Anime style illustration, Studio Ghibli inspired, a smiling elderly grandmother kneading fresh bread dough on a flour-dusted wooden counter. She has grey hair in a bun, glasses, and wears a cheerful floral apron. The scene is a cozy, rustic kitchen bathed in warm sunlight from a window with checkered curtains. Details include: two freshly baked loaves cooling on a rack, jars of ingredients, wooden utensils, and potted herbs. Below the counter, a small stone hearth glows with firelight. An orange tabby cat sleeps peacefully on a cushion next to the counter. Intricate background detail, soft shadows, domestic slice of life, 9:16 aspect ratio.",
