  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed traditional Chinese illustration, Guohua style, Donghua Chinese animation aesthetic, ink wash painting, dynamic composition (16:9). A vast, expansive field of golden, ripe wheat under a ferocious thunderstorm. Ominous, swirling dark thunderclouds dominate the sky, dramatically lit by multiple intense, jagged white lightning strikes. Heavy, visible streaks of rain pour down. In the middle ground, a traditional red and black octagonal Chinese pavilion (gazebo) stands on a small rise. Two small figures, cloaked travelers in traditional robes, walk along winding paths through the dense, bowing wheat stalks, seeking shelter. Misty, ink-washed green mountains are visible in the distance.",
