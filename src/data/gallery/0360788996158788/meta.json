  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (photorealistic), 8k, ultra detailed, cinematic still of a mature female librarian with a gentle smile, standing in a vast, historic library aisle, carefully stacking old leather-bound books. Dramatic, high-contrast volumetric lighting (god rays) streams through a tall window on the left, casting warm, golden light across the wooden floor and illuminating the atmospheric dust. Long rows of intricate dark wooden bookshelves recede into the background under a vaulted ceiling. Shallow depth of field, high quality photography, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
