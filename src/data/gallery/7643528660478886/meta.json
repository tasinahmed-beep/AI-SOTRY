  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed fantasy illustration, full body view of a majestic and peaceful giant panda, centered, sitting comfortably while happily eating a glowing bamboo stalk, eyes closed in serene contentment. Swirling golden spiritual energy (Qi) encircles the panda's torso. The scene is set in a highly luminous and ethereal Xianxia bamboo forest, framed by tall bamboo shoots. Below the panda, a small, crystal-clear waterfall cascades over spirit-infused rocks. Glowing blue crystals, luminous fog, and ethereal blue flowers adorn the mossy banks. In the distant, misty background, a traditional Chinese tiered pagoda/temple floats among thick white clouds. Neon glowing talismans and lanterns hang from the branches. Dramatic cinematic lighting, painterly details, vertical aspect ratio 9:16.",
