  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed, 8k, Fantasy Xianxia style, cinematic lighting, wide 16:9 aspect ratio. A lone Xianxia cultivator in flowing white and blue robes sits meditating on a mossy rock in a tranquil pond, surrounded by a radiant golden Qi energy sphere and swirling magical talismans. Majestic multi-tiered waterfalls cascade down towering mountain cliffs. In the bright, mist-filled sky above the falls, two massive golden celestial dragons are soaring, bathed in ethereal sunrise light. Glowing blue lotus flowers bloom on the water's surface, surrounded by luminous, teal-colored foliage and ancient trees. Rainbow mist effect, epic scale.",
