  "title": "POW! Underwater Comic Chaos",
  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed Comic Book illustration of a psychedelic coral reef ecosystem, 9:16 aspect ratio. The scene is teeming with dozens of highly saturated tropical fish (clownfish, angelfish), vibrant pink, purple, orange, and green corals, and giant, surreal mushroom-like flora. Two stylized, cartoon sharks swim in the brightly lit blue surface water. Focus on strong, thick black outlines, bold flat colors, high contrast, halftone shading texture, and incorporating pop art speech bubbles and sound effects (like \"POW!\") into the environment.",
