  "title": "Blue Rain Concerto Under the Elevated Rails",
  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed, 16:9 ratio, a breathtaking cinematic scene in 2D Anime style. A young anime woman with long blue hair, full body, passionately playing a violin under a colossal concrete elevated railway viaduct. Heavy rain is falling, creating sharp reflections and puddles on the wet street. She wears a long, flowing white dress and a black formal jacket. Warm streetlights cast an orange glow on the massive pillars, contrasting with the cool blue cyberpunk cityscape background. A sleek elevated train passes rapidly overhead. An open violin case rests on the ground. Neo-futuristic city skyline, depth of field, moody atmosphere, dynamic pose, detailed line art, stunning visual effects.",
