A dynamic, close-up shot of a cheerful young male snowboarder mid-air, executing a massive jump off a jagged, snow-covered alpine cliff edge. He is wearing vibrant teal jacket and orange snow pants, reflective goggles pushed over his eyes. Snow powder sprays dynamically from the board. The background features towering, stylized, snow-capped peaks and a deep rocky canyon lined with pristine pine trees. Bright daylight, clear blue sky with puffy clouds, cinematic lighting, extreme depth of field.",
