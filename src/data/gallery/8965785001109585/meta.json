  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, ultra detailed, (2D Anime style), Studio Ghibli aesthetic background art, 16:9 aspect ratio. A serene and peaceful indoor scene. A beautifully shaped, ancient-looking bonsai tree in a dark green ceramic pot resting on a rustic wooden side table. Next to the table, a large arched window with white muntins reveals a spectacular springtime view: rolling green hills, a winding blue river, and a distant, snow-capped Mount Fuji under a clear blue sky with fluffy white clouds. Scattered pink cherry blossom (sakura) petals float gently in the air inside the sunlit room. A small, peaceful calico cat is curled up, sleeping soundly on the bottom shelf of the wooden table. Warm sunlight streams through the window, creating distinct, sharp shadows on the light wooden floorboards. Cozy atmosphere, soft lighting, detailed textures, high resolution.",
