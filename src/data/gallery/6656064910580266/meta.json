A wide shot depicting a male astronaut in a classic white and orange space suit floating dramatically out of a large circular open hatch or window of a detailed, modular, grey space station. He is tethered by a yellow cord. Three surprised male crew members in vintage 1970s shirts are visible inside the cockpit watching the sudden event. The background features deep space, a distant complex space station structure with solar panels, a vibrant blue and magenta nebula, and the curve of planet Earth in the corner.
