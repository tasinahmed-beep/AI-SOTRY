  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed CG illustration, Modern Anime style, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio, a cute anime girl librarian, round glasses, reddish-brown hair tied in a messy bun, wearing a beige cardigan and a dark pleated skirt, standing on a wooden rolling library ladder. She is carefully stacking a tall pile of old books onto a high wooden shelf. Incredible depth perspective of a vast, classical university library aisle, floor-to-ceiling dark wooden bookshelves stretching into the distance. Dramatic volumetric lighting, intense god rays filtering through large arched windows in the background, creating a warm, golden glow. Floating dust motes illuminated by the sunlight, cozy and academic atmosphere, cinematic composition, soft shading.",
