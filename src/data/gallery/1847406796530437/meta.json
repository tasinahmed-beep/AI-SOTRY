She holds a tall stack of ancient books. The library features towering, dark wooden bookshelves and massive arched windows with ornate stained glass, blending Gothic and Eastern architectural styles. Powerful sunbeams (god rays) cut through the air, illuminating dust motes and subtle glowing magical energy. Several books are floating mid-air, guided by subtle cultivation magic. Outside the windows is a breathtaking view of misty mountains, clouds, and traditional Chinese pagodas. Foreground includes potted glowing blue lotus flowers.
