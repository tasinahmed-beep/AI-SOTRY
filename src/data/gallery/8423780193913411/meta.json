A serene, bald young monk wearing saffron and red robes, sitting in a cross-legged meditative pose on a stone perch overlooking a pond. Majestic twin waterfalls cascade down from stylized, misty teal mountains in the background. Flanking the waterfall are vibrant pink cherry blossom (sakura) trees. A translucent, ethereal azure water spirit dragon swirls dynamically around the monk, symbolizing spiritual power. Below, a tranquil pond with swimming koi fish and lily pads.
