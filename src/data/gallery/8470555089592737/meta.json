  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (photorealistic:1.3), cinematic vertical shot (9:16) of a dedicated street vendor wearing a baseball cap and jacket, grilling rows of Mexican street corn (elote) on a hot charcoal cart during a heavy rainstorm at night. The cart is illuminated by warm string lights and a bright bulb, creating strong, volumetric light streaks in the falling rain. Intense contrast between the warm glow of the fire and the cold, dark, wet pavement and background skyscrapers. Dramatic depth of field, ultra-detailed textures, steam rising from the grill, urban atmosphere.",
