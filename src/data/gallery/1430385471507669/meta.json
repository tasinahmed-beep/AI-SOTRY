  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, stunning 3D cinematic render, Pixar style animation. An adorable, joyful, plump grandmother with gray hair tied up in a bun, wearing spectacles and a floral apron, smiling radiantly directly at the viewer. She is kneading a large ball of dough on a rustic wooden baking table, surrounded by ingredients and freshly baked bread loaves. The setting is a deeply cozy, old-fashioned kitchen with wooden beams and textured plaster walls. In the background, a traditional brick wood-fired oven glows brightly with roaring fire. Soft, warm golden hour volumetric lighting streams from the window on the left. A fluffy, sleeping orange tabby cat rests patiently on a small wooden stool beside the table. Rustic kitchen decor, highly detailed textures, 9:16 aspect ratio.",
