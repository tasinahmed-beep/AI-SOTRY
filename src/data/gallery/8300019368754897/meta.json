  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed 3D render, Pixar Style illustration, (9:16 aspect ratio): A charming, whimsical bonsai tree with plump, spherical green foliage and a thick, twisted brown trunk, centered in a deep blue glossy ceramic pot. The pot rests on a warm, textured wooden shelf underneath a large, arched window frame. Intense backlighting from the window creates volumetric light shafts and soft lens flares, highlighting visible dust motes. Outside, a bright, stylized landscape of rolling green and autumnal hills and distant snow-capped mountains under a clear blue sky. Cozy interior lighting, miniature watering can and small gardening tools resting next to the pot.",
