  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, ultra detailed, a stunningly beautiful young Chinese baker woman, wearing an elegant pink Hanfu-style dress and a traditional apron, gracefully dusting a large pile of golden-brown croissants with powdered sugar using a fine sieve. The scene is set inside a warm, richly decorated traditional Chinese kitchen, complete with hanging red lanterns and a roaring oven featuring a golden dragon bas-relief. Through a wide, ornate window, a breathtaking fantastical landscape is visible: floating islands hosting ancient Chinese palaces and structures, framed by blooming pink cherry blossom branches. Dynamic volumetric lighting, ethereal atmosphere, Donghua Chinese style, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
