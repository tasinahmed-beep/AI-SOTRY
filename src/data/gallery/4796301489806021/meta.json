  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, high detail, 9:16 aspect ratio, a heartwarming, stylized scene in clear Pixar Style 3D animation. An elderly, friendly fisherman with a bushy white beard, wearing a patched blue jacket, stands on a mossy rock outcrop in a calm mountain lake. He is captured mid-action, powerfully casting his fishing rod. Dramatic sunrise light, the huge golden sun is visible between two majestic, forested mountain peaks, casting a brilliant sun pillar reflection across the water surface. The sky is a soft blend of pastel orange, pink, and blue. The foreground includes a small wooden dock, a moored rowboat, and two stylized fish jumping near the lure. Smooth rendering, soft volumetric lighting, cinematic atmosphere.",
