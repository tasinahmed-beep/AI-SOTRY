  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed, comic book illustration style, 16:9 aspect ratio. A cheerful, smiling elderly woman (grandmother) with spectacles and a bun, wearing a pink floral sweater and a white apron, happily kneading a large lump of bread dough on a rustic wooden table. Full-body shot, eye-level angle. The background is a spacious, cozy, old-fashioned kitchen featuring a prominent large brick wood-fired oven containing loaves of baking bread. Sunlight streams through the window. The room includes charming details: deep wooden shelving stocked with jars, two tall antique grandfather clocks, a wooden rocking chair, and two tabby cats sleeping peacefully nearby. Warm, inviting color palette, strong black outlines, expressive cross-hatching, vintage comic texture, panel layout.",
