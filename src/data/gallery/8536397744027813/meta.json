  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), detailed illustration, 2D Anime style, 16:9 aspect ratio, a dynamic scene featuring an energetic young male chef proudly tossing a massive pizza dough high into the air, detailed motion lines around the spinning dough. He wears a clean white chef uniform and checkered apron, with spiky brown hair. The setting is a rustic, warm pizza kitchen with a huge, glowing brick wood-fired oven dominating the right side, flames visible inside. Bright volumetric sunlight streams through a large window on the left, creating strong highlights and dust motes. Two secondary chefs (one older man, one young woman in a bandana) are visible in the background working at the wooden counter. Detailed background, food preparation, cheerful expression, wide shot.",
