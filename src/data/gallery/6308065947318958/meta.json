  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed cinematic 3D rendering, Pixar style character design, full body shot of a youthful busker playing a violin intensely, eyes closed in concentration. The musician wears a thick blue knitted sweater and a plaid scarf. Golden, glowing musical notes and magical energy swirl vividly above the violin strings. The character stands on a wet cobblestone path beside a river under a massive, dark industrial metal bridge arch. An open vintage suitcase containing coins rests beside the busker's feet. In the background, visible through the arch, is a stunning Steampunk city skyline featuring grand towers and flying dirigibles, illuminated by soft golden sunset light. Volumetric lighting, autumnal setting, 9:16 aspect ratio.",
