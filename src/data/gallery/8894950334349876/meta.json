  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, absurd resolution, A gentle, smiling Asian grandmother (laolao) wearing a detailed, vibrant traditional Chinese outfit (red and teal), kneading bread dough on a rustic wooden counter in a cozy, traditional Chinese kitchen. Warm golden backlighting streaming through large traditional windows. Prominent, ornate clay oven shaped like a stylized mythical creature's head (dragon/lion motif) with glowing fire inside. A cute orange and white cat sleeping peacefully on a small wooden stool beside the oven. Freshly baked braided loaves cooling nearby. Baskets of fresh herbs, hanging dried peppers, and traditional ceramic teaware on wooden shelves. Soft atmospheric lighting, subtle glowing particles, nostalgic, slice of life, Donghua Chinese style, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
