A dynamic scene featuring a handsome, muscular baker wearing a crisp white toque and apron, smiling intensely while energetically dusting a huge pile of golden croissants with powdered sugar from a metal sieve. Dramatic sugar splash effect creating a white cloud. Bold black ink outlines, classic comic book shading (hatching and cross-hatching), vibrant flat colors, high contrast, and dynamic action pose.
