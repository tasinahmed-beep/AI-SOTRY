  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, 3D render, Pixar style animation, full shot, a heartwarming scene of a cheerful elderly grandmother kneading a large mound of bread dough on a flour-dusted rustic wooden table. She has gray hair tied in a bun, glasses, and wears a floral apron. The kitchen is cozy and warm, featuring heavy wooden beams, a prominent stone fireplace with a crackling fire, and a smaller stone bread oven. Warm, soft sunlight streams through a large circular window in the background. A small, adorable ginger cat sits patiently on a wooden stool nearby, observing the baking. Freshly baked loaves cool on a rack. Volumetric lighting, inviting atmosphere, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
