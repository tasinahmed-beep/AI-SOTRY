A determined, muscular male firefighter walking directly toward the viewer, full-body portrait, dramatic pose. He wears detailed, futuristic turnout gear (dark grey and reflective orange accents) and a tactical helmet. He holds a large, intimidating, multi-barreled fire hose nozzle (water cannon). He is emerging from thick, billowing grey smoke and embers, walking across cracked rubble ground. In the background, a destroyed city skyline is silhouetted against a dramatic, vibrant orange sunset/apocalyptic sky. Modern Anime style, strong line art, dynamic shadows, high contrast.",
