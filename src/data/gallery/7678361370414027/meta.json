  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed digital painting, 16:9 aspect ratio, Fantasy Xianxia style. A powerful immortal warrior figure in ornate, flowing crimson and gold dragon-scale armor, wearing a majestic winged helmet, strides purposefully through a catastrophic elemental conflict. He wields a massive, enchanted hose, spraying a brilliant, crystalline blue torrent of magical water that slices through swirling clouds of volatile red and golden mystical fire and smoke. Epic floating citadel and traditional Chinese pagoda visible on a distant mountain peak, illuminated by a glowing blue magical water vessel hanging beneath it. Foreground features an ancient cracked stone platform with arcane symbols and ethereal blue sparks. Dynamic composition, volumetric lighting, cinematic atmosphere.",
