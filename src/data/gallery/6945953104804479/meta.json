  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), photorealistic, 8k, cinematic lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio. A joyful elderly grandmother with silver hair, wearing a knitted cardigan and a floral apron, focused on kneading bread dough on a rustic wooden table covered in flour. In the background, a cozy farmhouse kitchen features a glowing brick wood-fired oven/hearth and a large window emitting soft golden hour light. Freshly baked golden bread loaves are visible on a tray, and a peaceful orange tabby cat is sleeping nearby on the table. Highly detailed, warm volumetric lighting, shallow depth of field, cottagecore aesthetic, nostalgic atmosphere.",
