  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, high detail, Fantasy Xianxia illustration, 16:9 aspect ratio. A magnificent, ancient Spirit Bonsai tree with glowing azure blue leaves and two intertwined ethereal white celestial dragons forming the canopy. A tiny ancient temple sits within the roots on a floating rock, connected by a delicate bridge. The bonsai rests prominently on an intricately carved wooden shelf, perfectly framed by an ornate circular Chinese moon gate window. Dramatic wide shot of a breathtaking misty Xianxia landscape background featuring towering floating karst peaks, multiple powerful waterfalls cascading into the fog, scattered traditional pagodas on the cliffs, and glowing magical vapor during a vibrant sunset/sunrise. Soft atmospheric lighting, magic particles, ultra-detailed digital painting.",
