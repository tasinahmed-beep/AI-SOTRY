  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed 3D rendering, Pixar style character illustration, cinematic volumetric lighting, 9:16 aspect ratio. A joyful grandmother with rosy cheeks, round glasses, and neatly tied grey hair, wearing a patterned floral apron, intensely focused on kneading soft bread dough on a rustic wooden countertop dusted with flour. In the background, a large traditional wood-fired oven glowing with visible flames, casting a warm orange glow. Cozy, detailed kitchen interior featuring wooden beams, ceramic pottery on wooden shelves, and bright sunlight streaming through a lace-curtained window revealing a blooming garden outside. Freshly baked braided loaves and a bowl of fresh berries are on the table. An adorable, plump orange tabby cat is curled up sleeping peacefully on a small wooden stool nearby. Warm, inviting, and nostalgic atmosphere.",
