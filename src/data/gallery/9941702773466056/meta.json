  "prompt": "(masterpiece), 8k, highly detailed 3D render in Pixar animation style, cinematic volumetric lighting, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. A cheerful, portly male chef with a thick brown mustache, wearing a crisp white toque and red neckerchief, is enthusiastically slicing colorful fresh vegetables (zucchini, red onion, bell peppers) on a thick wooden cutting board. Dynamic motion capture of the action, with chopped vegetables flying into a metal bowl. Focus on the chef's joyful expression and large hands. Rustic kitchen background with exposed brick walls, hanging cookware, and strong natural daylight streaming through a large arched window revealing an Italian village outside. Sharp focus, depth of field.",
