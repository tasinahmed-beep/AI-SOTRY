  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), detailed comic book panel illustration, a determined female scientist with curly brown hair and glasses, wearing a white lab coat and blue shirt, intensely focused on a complex microscope in a high-tech laboratory. The lab desk is cluttered with chemistry equipment, including brightly colored orange liquid in conical flasks and test tubes. The scene uses a dramatic teal and cyan lighting scheme with strong black outlines and visible halftone dot texture. Thought bubbles containing stylized illustrations of complex cells, microorganisms, and a DNA helix are floating above her head. Dynamic composition, full vertical view, 9:16 aspect ratio, classic comic book style.",
