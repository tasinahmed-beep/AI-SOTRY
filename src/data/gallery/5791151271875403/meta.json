  "prompt": "A high-quality, detailed illustration (masterpiece) in the Donghua Chinese animation style, 16:9 aspect ratio. A serene, elderly Chinese grandmother (p√≥po) with silver hair tied up, wearing a traditional embroidered red robe with flying crane motifs, happily kneading bread dough on a rustic wooden table dusted with flour. She is centered in a warm, cozy kitchen featuring traditional wooden architecture and hanging lotus lanterns. Dominating the background is a large, beehive-shaped clay oven with glowing fire inside, emitting gentle steam. Sunlight streams through a large lattice window overlooking a vibrant spring garden with blooming cherry blossoms (sakura); pink petals drift indoors. A peaceful black cat sleeps curled up on a bench near the window. Freshly baked bread buns rest on a bamboo rack nearby. Detailed bowls containing grains, spices, and ingredients are scattered on the table. Cinematic lighting, volumetric atmosphere, highly detailed textures, inviting ambiance.",
