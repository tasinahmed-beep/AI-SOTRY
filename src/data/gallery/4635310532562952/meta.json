Rainy night setting. She is sheltered by a massive red traditional oil-paper umbrella. Warm light radiating intensely from the grill fire and hanging red Chinese lanterns. Heavy raindrops falling, visible rain effect, wet cobblestone street reflecting neon signs and lights. Traditional Chinese architecture and pagoda rooftops visible in the blurred background. Donghua Chinese style, vibrant colors, atmospheric, detailed character art, high contrast.",
