  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed 2D Anime illustration, 16:9, a joyous middle-aged street vendor smiling brightly, cooking five ears of yakitoumogi (grilled corn on the cob) on a glowing charcoal grill. Intense steam rising. Set on a dark Japanese city street during heavy rainfall at night. Strong warm lighting emanating from the grill and three red chochin lanterns under a small awning. The wet asphalt reflects the neon signs and rain puddles. Two customers standing under umbrellas nearby in the background. Volumetric light, atmospheric effects.",
