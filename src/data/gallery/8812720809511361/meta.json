  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, ultra-detailed digital painting, cinematic lighting, vertical aspect ratio (9:16). A captivating Fantasy Xianxia scene: An elegant male cultivator, wearing flowing deep blue robes with intricate embroidery, is meticulously pouring milk from a jade-green pitcher into a large white coffee cup. The milk is luminous and shimmering with golden starlight, magically forming a three-dimensional, ethereal winged spirit (like a miniature celestial griffin or phoenix chick) emerging from the latte art pattern. The setting is a beautifully carved traditional Chinese pagoda balcony high up in the mountains. In the foreground, vibrant pink and yellow lotus flowers are scattered on the dark wooden table. The background reveals a breathtaking vista of vast, misty, jagged mountain peaks, winding river valleys, and floating clouds, with small figures (other cultivators) flying in the distance. Volumetric atmosphere, highly detailed environment.",
