  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed 3D Pixar Style animation render, a vibrant and dynamic scene: A cheerful young female street artist, wearing paint-splattered denim overalls and a white shirt, stands on a cobblestone street at dawn. She is actively painting a colorful, whimsical mural (featuring suns, clouds, and bubbles) on a tall red brick wall. She holds a paint roller and a brush, smiling joyfully. A small, cute, slightly dirty companion robot stands next to her, observing. The background features old townhouses silhouetted against a pastel pink and orange sunrise sky. Surreal element: Two large, peaceful whales are floating/swimming high in the morning sky. Soft volumetric lighting, golden hour illumination, cinematic composition. Vertical orientation (9:16 aspect ratio).",
