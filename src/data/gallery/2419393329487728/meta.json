  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, 16:9 aspect ratio, Donghua Chinese animation style illustration. A heroic astronaut, wearing a custom spacesuit inspired by ancient Chinese general armor (white, red, and gold detailing, dragon motif on armor plates, flowing sashes), vigorously plants a large ceremonial flag into the dusty, desolate alien surface. The white banner features a golden imperial dragon emblem and elegant Chinese calligraphy. The backdrop is a dramatic space landscape with towering, stylized mountains, swirling pink and purple cosmic clouds, visible constellations, and a teal planet glowing in the dark sky. Full body shot, dynamic action pose, sense of awe and pioneering spirit.",
