  "title": "Serene Matcha Ceremony on Bamboo",
  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed, photorealistic 9:16 portrait shot of a traditional Japanese Matcha tea ceremony setup (Chanoyu). Detailed close-up of a rustic black cast iron tetsubin (kettle) sitting on a charcoal stove with a subtle heat glow, accompanied by a bowl of vibrant green matcha, a bamboo whisk (chasen), speckled ceramic chawan cups, and a matcha powder jar. The entire arrangement is set on a highly polished, textured bamboo table. In the softly blurred background (shallow depth of field), a minimalist Japanese interior is visible, featuring a window with sheer white curtains, a delicate bonsai tree, and a hanging calligraphy scroll (kakemono). Soft, warm natural lighting illuminates the scene, emphasizing the wabi-sabi aesthetic and material textures.",
