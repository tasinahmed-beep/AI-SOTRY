  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), cinematic lighting, high detail 3D Anime rendering, 16:9 aspect ratio. A young street artist with bright blue spiked hair and protective goggles, dressed in casual layered clothes, standing on a metal scaffold. The artist is focused on spray painting the final details onto a massive, complex graffiti mural covering a weathered red brick wall. The mural depicts a vibrant futuristic cityscape silhouette and stylized flying machines against a fiery sunrise gradient (purple, orange, blue). The scene is set in a narrow, misty European alleyway at dawn. Soft, golden volumetric lighting casts long shadows across the historic cobblestone street. Scattered empty spray cans lie around the base of the scaffold and on the pavement. Detailed textures, sharp focus.",
