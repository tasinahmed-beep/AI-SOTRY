  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, cinematic lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio. A joyful, friendly male street artist, slightly overweight, wearing blue denim overalls and thick glasses, his hair tied back in a ponytail, diligently painting a vibrant, cheerful mural on a textured red brick wall. The mural depicts colorful, anthropomorphic block houses with happy faces, a smiling sun, and a bicycle. The artist is holding a large paintbrush. Art supplies (brushes, paints) are arranged on a small rolling cart beside him. The scene is set on a quiet, cobblestone European street during the warm, golden hour of dawn. Shallow depth of field, detailed background showing blurred traditional townhouses and a few early morning passersby. Highly detailed 3D render, Pixar style, whimsical, expressive character design.",
