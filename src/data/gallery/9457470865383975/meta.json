  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (photorealistic), 8k highly detailed cinematic photograph, a professional Italian chef (Pizzaiolo) wearing a clean black apron and white uniform, captured in a moment of action, expertly tossing a large, round pizza dough high in the air. Flour dust is visible, suspended in the dramatic, volumetric light streaming from a tall window on the left. The setting is a rustic kitchen with rich red brick walls and a blazing wood-fired brick oven glowing brightly in the background. The foreground features a flour-dusted wooden prep table with fresh ingredients like red tomatoes, basil, and partially prepared Margherita pizzas. Dramatic backlighting, high contrast, perfect focus, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio.",
