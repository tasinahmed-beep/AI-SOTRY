  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed, photorealistic 16:9 cinematic shot of a bald Buddhist monk wearing vibrant orange robes, meditating in the full lotus position (Padmasana) with hands in Dhyana Mudra. The monk sits calmly on a moss-covered rock outcrop directly beneath a massive, cascading waterfall complex. The scene is set in a majestic, lush valley surrounded by towering, jagged, moss-covered mountain cliffs. A brilliant, vivid rainbow is visible in the dense waterfall mist. Ethereal volumetric lighting, deep focus, hyperdetailed water spray, ancient mossy trees framing the composition, serene atmosphere.",
