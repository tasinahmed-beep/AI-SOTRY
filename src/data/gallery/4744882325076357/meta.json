  "title": "The Celestial Toss of the Imperial Kitchen",
  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, a wide-shot (16:9) cinematic scene of a handsome young Chinese chef expertly tossing a large pizza dough high in the air. He wears a traditional silk Chinese tunic and a decorative apron. The background features a rustic yet refined brick oven kitchen, multiple wood-fired arches glowing warmly. The main pizza oven is highly ornate, decorated with vibrant red and intricate gold Donghua-style cloud motifs. Exposed brick walls, hanging red chili peppers and garlic braids, soft glow from traditional paper lanterns. Highly detailed mise en place in the foreground: organized bowls of fresh ingredients (mozzarella balls, sauces, chopped vegetables). Volumetric lighting, photorealistic rendering, detailed background action with supporting kitchen staff preparing food.",
