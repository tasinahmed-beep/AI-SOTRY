  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, absurd resolution, atmospheric lighting, volumetric lighting, full composition, Fantasy Xianxia style, Chinese Fantasy Illustration, 16:9 aspect ratio. A gigantic, smiling, spiritual panda covered in intricate blue tribal tattoos sits peacefully in the foreground, happily eating a thick stalk of fresh bamboo. It is nestled in a lush, ancient bamboo forest grove, surrounded by glowing bioluminescent flora, blue mushrooms, and purple flowers. In the majestic background, sharp, towering mountain peaks rise through dense, soft mist and clouds (sea of clouds). Multiple cascading waterfalls flow down the cliffs. Traditional ancient green-tiled Chinese pagodas and temples are built into the mountainside. Mythical flying koi fish and phoenix-like birds soar through the middle ground. Dreamy, magical ambiance, epic scale.",
