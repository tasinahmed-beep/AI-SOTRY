She is smiling brightly while using a metal sieve to dust a large pile of perfect, golden-brown croissants with fine powdered sugar. Soft volumetric lighting, visible sugar dust particles floating in the air, warm interior background featuring wooden counters, shelves stocked with artisan bread baskets, and bright sunlight streaming through a large arched window. Shallow depth of field, focused composition. 9:16 aspect ratio.",
