  "title": "Zen Serenity: The Traditional Matcha Ceremony",
  "prompt": "(masterpiece), 8k, photorealistic rendering of a traditional Japanese tea ceremony (Chanoyu) setup. A low, intricately woven bamboo table holds the implements. Center focus on a textured black cast iron tetsubin kettle resting on a glowing stone brazier. Beside it, two handcrafted ceramic matcha bowls (chawan) with green and white glaze, a bamboo chasen whisk, a red lacquer box containing bright green matcha powder, and a single delicate pink camellia flower. The scene is set on tatami mats in a minimalist Japanese room with blurred shoji screens and an ikebana arrangement in the background. Soft, diffused natural light illuminates the scene, sharp focus, detailed textures, cinematic lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
