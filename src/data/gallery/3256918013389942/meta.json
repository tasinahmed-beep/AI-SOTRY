  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio, Donghua Chinese illustration style, an elegant young man (bishonen) with long dark hair tied in a traditional bun, wearing flowing turquoise and cloud-patterned Hanfu robes over deep red undergarments. He is standing indoors in a traditional Chinese tea house setting, surrounded by intricate carved wooden lattice screens and soft hanging paper lanterns. He holds a white porcelain cup decorated with blue lotus flowers and delicately pours steamed milk from a copper pitcher into the beverage. Magical, glowing ethereal latte art forms instantly: a shimmering white phoenix and a lotus flower rising from the steaming drink. Soft, warm ambient lighting, delicate pink cherry blossom branches framing the upper corners, misty mountains visible through the window/screen.",
