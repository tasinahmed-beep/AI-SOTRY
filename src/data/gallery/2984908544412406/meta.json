  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, 8k, cinematic view of a tranquil Japanese koi pond (Nishikigoi). Three vibrant koi fish swimming beneath the dark, reflective water surface. Overhanging cherry blossom (Sakura) trees dropping countless light pink petals, creating subtle concentric ripples on the water. Lush mossy stones and lily pads at the edges. In the background, a soft-focus traditional wooden bridge and a stone lantern (Tōrō). Golden hour sunlight, volumetric rays, soft diffused lighting, stylized realism, Pixar animation style rendering, ultra-detailed texture, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
