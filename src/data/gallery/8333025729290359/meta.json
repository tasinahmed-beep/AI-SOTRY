  "prompt": "(masterpiece), hyperdetailed, photorealistic food photography, a close-up shot of a baker's hands gently sifting powdered sugar from a metal sieve over a fresh batch of golden, flaky croissants arranged closely together on a dark wooden cutting board. The sugar particles are perfectly captured mid-air. Soft, diffused natural light streams powerfully from a large, industrial-style window in the background, creating a strong contrast and shallow depth of field (bokeh). Warm ambient lighting, professional commercial quality, high resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
