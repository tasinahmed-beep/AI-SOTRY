  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, ultra-detailed cinematic 3D anime render, 9:16 aspect ratio. An awe-inspiring, hyper-colorful underwater scene of a thriving coral reef. A gentle, large whale shark with cute chibi features swims majestically in the upper half, illuminated by dramatic volumetric god rays piercing the turquoise water surface. Below, the reef is dense with intensely saturated, neon-colored corals\b\b\b pink branching coral, blue brain coral, and red tube sponges. Dozens of adorable tropical fish swim everywhere, including detailed clownfish, blue tangs, and yellow butterflyfish. A massive school of small silver baitfish swirls dynamically near the whale shark. Sharp focus, high saturation, Pixar style, deep depth of field.",
