  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, absurdly detailed fantasy landscape, epic wide shot, 16:9 aspect ratio, Modern Anime style. A colossal, intricate castle combining medieval and Eastern architectural elements, resting on a towering, rocky mountain peak, overlooking an infinite sea of glowing, thick fog and clouds. The castle structure features subtle blue magical lighting accents and highly detailed turrets. Below the fog, a small village is visible, connected by a winding, luminous blue river or path of light. Dramatic sky at the moment of dusk or dawn, featuring a massive bright sun on the horizon and a clear crescent moon simultaneously visible. Several white birds are soaring gracefully around the misty peak. Soft volumetric lighting, ethereal atmosphere, cinematic composition, pastel colors.",
