  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed cinematic render of a skilled young Chinese artist wearing intricate silk Hanfu robes, meticulously painting a vast traditional ink wash mural on a textured grey brick wall in a quiet, ancient Chinese street at early dawn. The mural artwork prominently features a majestic white Fenghuang (Phoenix) soaring among stylized clouds, vibrant cherry blossom branches, and subtle blue-green mountains (Shanshui painting style). The outline of a powerful Chinese dragon is visible on the right. Soft, golden volumetric dawn light highlights the scene, casting subtle shadows. Traditional Chinese architecture surrounds the cobblestone street. 16:9 aspect ratio, Donghua Chinese style, intricate textile patterns, atmospheric lighting.",
