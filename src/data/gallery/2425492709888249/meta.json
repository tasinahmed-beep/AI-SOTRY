A dynamic scene featuring a heroic male surfer riding a massive, churning emerald green wave at sunset. A powerful golden celestial dragon is visibly swimming through the wave crest, its head emerging from the spray. The background shows dramatic, stylized orange and pink ruyi clouds framing a bright sun disk, set above traditional Chinese mountainous islands dotted with dark pagodas and vibrant pink cherry blossom trees.
