  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (photorealistic:1.2), hyperdetailed, 8k rendering, vertical composition (9:16). A solitary street artist wearing a fedora and paint-splattered work clothes stands on a metal scaffolding, focused on spray painting a large, vibrant, graphic mural on a dark red brick wall. The mural depicts a stylized cityscape silhouette with dynamic lines, glowing with orange and yellow tones contrasted against deep blue areas. The scene is set in a cobblestone alleyway at sunrise. Dramatic golden hour lighting, intense side light creating long shadows across the wet pavement. Atmospheric perspective, visible mist/haze, subtle glowing particles in the air. Scattered spray paint cans and equipment on the ground. A vintage lamppost stands silhouetted against the bright, hazy morning sky and distant city skyline.",
