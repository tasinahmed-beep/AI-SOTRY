  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed digital illustration, Fantasy Xianxia style, 9:16 aspect ratio, vertical orientation. A breathtaking view through a large, circular traditional wooden window frame. Centered on an ancient, majestic bonsai tree with glowing light effects on the leaves and a gnarled, twisting trunk, planted in a decorative porcelain pot. Mystical water flow/qi energy cascades from the pot roots onto the shelf. The bonsai rests on an intricately carved wooden floating shelf, surrounded by soft, ethereal clouds. Next to the pot are rolled-up ancient scrolls tied with silk ribbons, a small dragon statue, and a steaming silver teapot set. In the distance, the view reveals a serene Xianxia landscape: floating mountain islands, elegant Wuxia-style pagodas and temples built into the misty cliffs, arched stone bridges, and white cranes flying in the soft pastel morning sky. Ethereal lighting, soft mist, deep depth of field.",
