The fox has intricate glowing runes and patterns on its fur and six voluminous tails, one foot raised. In the foreground, a winding path of luminous blue crystal and ice flows across the snow, scattered with delicate pink cherry blossoms and large glowing ice crystals. The background features towering, mist-shrouded Xianxia mountains (karst peaks), with ancient pagodas and temples built into the floating cliffs. A massive, radiant full moon dominates the starry night sky with visible constellations. Falling golden leaves and light snow flurries create a mystical, ethereal atmosphere.
