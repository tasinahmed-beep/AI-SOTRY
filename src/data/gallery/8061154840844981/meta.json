  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed CGI 3D render in Pixar Style, vertical 9:16 portrait. A charming, portly male baker with rosy cheeks, a thick mustache, and a tall white toque chef's hat, smiling joyfully. He is standing in a cozy, warm bakery kitchen. The baker is using a metal sifter to lightly dust a large metal tray full of perfectly golden-brown, flaky croissants with fine powdered sugar. Volumetric morning light streams through a large round window in the background, illuminating the sugar dust particles. Wooden countertops and shelves filled with fresh bread loaves are visible in the warm, diffused background.",
