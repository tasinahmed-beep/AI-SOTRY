  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed 3D render, Pixar Style animation scene, a whimsical street artist with a large nose, beard, beanie, and paint-splattered overalls, standing on a cobblestone sidewalk and diligently painting a large, vibrant mural onto a textured red brick wall. The colorful mural depicts a smiling sun, a winding blue river, a large tree, and adorable cartoon farm animals (sheep, llamas). Cinematic volumetric lighting of early dawn, soft pink and orange gradient sky, misty city skyline silhouettes in the background. A focused side view, painting supplies and brushes scattered near a small wooden stool. A single pigeon pecks near the artist's feet. 16:9 aspect ratio.",
