  "prompt": "(Masterpiece), ultra-detailed illustration in Fantasy Xianxia style, 9:16 aspect ratio. A handsome, serious male cultivator chef wearing opulent blue and gold robes is slicing vibrant, fantastical vegetables (such as glowing purple radishes and broccoli) on an old wooden table. He uses a glowing ethereal jade-colored spiritual sword as a knife. Wisps of Qi energy, manifesting as miniature crystalline spirit dragons, swirl around the blade and ingredients, creating a sense of magical motion. The background features a breathtaking view of floating mountains, lush greenery, mist, cascading waterfalls, and a traditional, ancient Chinese pagoda temple perched on a distant peak. Epic composition, dramatic lighting, volumetric lighting, highly intricate details, cinematic atmosphere.",
