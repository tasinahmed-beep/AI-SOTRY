  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, (detailed anime background art), A highly detailed shot of a magnificent, ancient bonsai tree with a thick, twisted trunk, sitting on a natural rustic wooden table. The scene is set inside a traditional Japanese room (wa-shitsu) featuring a shoji screen door, tatami flooring, and walls with subtle cherry blossom patterns. The bonsai is perfectly centered beneath a large, arched window which offers a breathtaking view of a vibrant spring landscape: rolling green hills dotted with lush pink cherry blossom trees (sakura), distant mountains, and a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds. Soft sunlight streams through the window. 3D Anime style, cel-shading, expressive lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
