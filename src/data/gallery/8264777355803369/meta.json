  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, ultra detailed, a cute anthropomorphic service robot with a smooth white shell and ornate gold trim, adorned with traditional Chinese cloud patterns, glowing blue eyes, happily watering lush houseplants (bamboo stalks, flowering orchids, succulents) with a small green watering can. The scene is set inside a luxurious traditional Chinese scholar's studio (tea room), rich wooden paneling, soft atmospheric lighting. Two large circular moon gate windows frame a breathtaking fantasy landscape of floating islands, misty mountains, high waterfalls, and ancient pagodas in the distance. Ethereal, flowing ribbons of water/Qi energy surround the plants and the robot. Donghua Chinese animation style, cinematic light, volumetric rendering, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
