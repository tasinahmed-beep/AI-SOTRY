  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed CGI render, 3D Anime style, cinematic volumetric lighting, 16:9 aspect ratio. A close-up view of a cheerful Japanese street food vendor smiling widely, wearing a simple apron and bandana, grilling multiple cobs of golden yakitomorokoshi (grilled corn) over glowing charcoal in a small mobile food stall (yatai). Heavy rain is falling, creating rain streaks and detailed splashes on the wet cobblestone street. The stall is illuminated by a warm, glowing traditional Japanese paper lantern (ch≈çchin) bearing Japanese text. Subtle steam rises from the hot grill. The background features blurred silhouettes of pedestrians holding umbrellas and colorful, neon Japanese signs, enhancing the atmosphere of a bustling rainy urban night.",
