  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-photorealistic studio photograph, cinematic lighting, full shot of a handsome male chef in a clean white uniform and tall toque, dynamically tossing a large circle of raw pizza dough high into the air. The chef stands centered in front of a massive, rustic red brick oven with intense glowing flames visible inside. The foreground features a stainless steel prep table dusted with flour, fresh ingredients like basil, tomatoes, and dough balls. Warm, dramatic low-key lighting from overhead industrial lamps and the oven fire creates deep shadows and highlights. Detailed industrial kitchen setting, pizza peels leaning against the brickwork, 16:9 aspect ratio, highly detailed texture.",
