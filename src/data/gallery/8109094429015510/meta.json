In the background, a massive brick hearth oven with roaring fire. Fresh loaves cooling on a rack near a window with red gingham checkered curtains. Detailed composition showing ingredients like flour, yeast jars, and eggs scattered nearby. A small tabby cat sleeps peacefully near the hearth. Speech bubble included: 'JUST LIKE GRANDPA USED TO MAKE!'. Full upper torso shot. 9:16 aspect ratio.",
