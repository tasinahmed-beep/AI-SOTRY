  "prompt": "(Masterpiece), (best quality), high detail, an iconic vertical comic book panel (9:16 aspect ratio), a beautiful young woman with long flowing red hair, wearing a stylish trench coat and black boots, standing centered under a massive, rusty industrial steel bridge arch. She is passionately playing a violin in the pouring rain. Overhead, a commuter train races past on the elevated track. In the background, visible through the bridge arch, is a detailed city skyline during a dramatic twilight/dusk. Strong noir lighting, heavy black outlines, detailed cross-hatching and shading, graphic novel composition, with a bold speech bubble showing 'MELODY!'.",
