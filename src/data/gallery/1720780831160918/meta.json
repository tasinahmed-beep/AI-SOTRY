  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, extremely detailed CG artwork, Modern Anime style, 16:9 aspect ratio. A serene, tranquil atmosphere inside a traditional Japanese room (washitsu). Full body shot of a beautiful young woman with long brown hair, wearing an elegant light-colored kimono with floral patterns, sitting seiza style on a tatami floor. She is holding a matcha bowl (chawan). A low, polished wooden table is set with traditional tea ceremony items: a dark iron tetsubin teapot, two bowls of vibrant green matcha, a bamboo whisk (chasen), and a small decorated box. Bright natural light streams through the opened shoji screens, illuminating the scene. Outside, a picturesque Japanese garden is visible, featuring a huge, fully bloomed cherry blossom tree (sakura). Gentle pink petals fall through the air. Soft focus background, volumetric lighting, atmospheric details.",
