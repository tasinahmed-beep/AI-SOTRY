The snowboard is highly detailed with golden dragon and cloud patterns. Below him is an expansive, misty snow-covered mountain landscape (shanshui), with winding rivers and ancient pine trees. Dramatic, radiant sunburst in the golden-orange sky, scattering pink cherry blossom petals and snow. Stylized Ruyi clouds and mountain mist frame the scene. Extreme vertical composition, clean line art, traditional Chinese color palette, 9:16 aspect ratio.",
