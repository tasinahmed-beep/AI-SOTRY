  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, 16:9 aspect ratio, Donghua Chinese style, full shot, an elegant young woman (librarian) wearing ornate, flowing traditional Chinese robes (Hanfu), standing on a small wooden stool, interacting with books on a towering, dark wooden bookshelf. Dramatic golden sunbeams (volumetric lighting, god rays) stream through colossal lattice windows that dominate the wall. The windows reveal an awe-inspiring celestial landscape of floating islands (Sky Islands) and white clouds. Luminous white butterflies and shimmering dust motes drift in the sunlit aisle.
