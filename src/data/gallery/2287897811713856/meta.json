  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), hyperdetailed photograph of a smiling elderly woman (grandmother) with silver hair, wearing a knitted sweater and a floral apron, intensely focused on kneading fresh bread dough on a worn wooden table covered in flour. A sleepy orange tabby cat rests beside the dough. Freshly baked loaves are cooling on a wire rack. Background features a deeply cozy, rustic farmhouse kitchen, lit primarily by the warm glow of a crackling fire in a brick hearth and soft natural light filtering from a nearby window. Focus on textural detail (wood grain, flour dust, knitted fabric). Cinematic lighting, low-key, depth of field, 9:16 aspect ratio, Photorealistic.",
