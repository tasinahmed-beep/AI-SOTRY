A full-body shot of a bold astronaut in a classic white spacesuit floating weightlessly directly in front of a large circular space station porthole. The view outside shows a dynamic, swirling purple and blue galaxy, distant stars, and a pale blue planet. The scene features thick black outlines, limited vibrant coloring, and visible halftone dot shading. A yellow tether cord connects to the suit. Include dramatic comic book style text effects like 'WHOOSH!' and 'GRAVITY NULLIFIED!'. Retro sci-fi aesthetic.",
