  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed 3D Anime illustration, 9:16 vertical aspect ratio. A serene young Buddhist monk in vibrant orange robes meditating in the lotus position (Padmasana) on a large, mossy rock. He is centered directly beneath a massive, powerful waterfall cascading down rocky cliffs. The scene is framed by blooming cherry blossom (Sakura) trees. In the background, majestic snow-capped mountains pierce a bright, clear blue sky. Turquoise water flows around the rock. Ethereal glowing motes of light and soft white butterflies float in the cool mist. Subtle volumetric lighting, tranquil atmosphere, cinematic composition.",
