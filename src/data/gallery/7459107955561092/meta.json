  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), high detail, 2D anime illustration, traditional Japanese art style, full body view, vertical aspect ratio (9:16). A serene couple performing a traditional Japanese tea ceremony (Chanoyu) indoors. The scene features a detailed bamboo table (take-dai) holding a complete tea set: steaming black tetsubin kettle, matcha whisk, chawan with vibrant green matcha, and wagashi sweets. The woman sits on the left, wearing a detailed pink kimono, opposite the man in a dark indigo kimono, both kneeling (seiza). The setting is a traditional tatami room with open shoji screens revealing a view of the night outside. The background is framed by blooming cherry blossom (sakura) trees, a view of rolling mountains, and a large, luminous full moon in the dark blue sky. Falling sakura petals (Hana Fubuki) drift gently in the air. Soft light, aesthetic illustration.",
