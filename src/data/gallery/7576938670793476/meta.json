  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), (detailed illustration), stunning 3D Anime render, 9:16 aspect ratio, a beautiful young anime woman with long, vibrant light blue hair tied in a high ponytail, carefully standing on a rolling wooden library ladder. She is placing a stack of historical books onto a high shelf. She wears a cozy beige cardigan sweater and a brown pleated school skirt. The environment is a grand, gothic library aisle with high vaulted arches and endless bookshelves. Intense, dramatic volumetric lighting (god rays) streams through large, intricate stained-glass windows on the left, illuminating the wooden floor and casting a warm, golden glow across the scene. Dust motes floating in the air, deep depth of field, octane render.",
