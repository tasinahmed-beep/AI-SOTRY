  "prompt": "(Masterpiece), (photorealistic:1.3), A stunning vertical shot (9:16) of a tranquil Japanese garden koi pond during cherry blossom season. The dark, reflective water is densely populated with vibrant Nishikigoi (red, white, and orange koi fish). The surface is covered in fresh, floating white and pink sakura petals, with more petals gently falling through the air, creating a soft bokeh effect. Visible ripples disturb the water near the foreground. In the soft, diffused background, a traditional wooden bridge spans the water, framed by lush green pine trees and mossy rocks. Soft overcast lighting, ultra detail, 8k resolution, cinematic atmosphere, shallow depth of field, natural colors.",
