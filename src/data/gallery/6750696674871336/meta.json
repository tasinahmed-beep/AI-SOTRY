  "prompt": "(Masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed cinematic illustration, Fantasy Xianxia style, 16:9 aspect ratio. A benevolent and graceful elderly female immortal (xian) with long silver hair, adorned with intricate jade and lotus hairpins, wearing flowing traditional Hanfu robes. She is centered, gently kneading a large mound of dough on a round wooden table. Swirling golden Qi (cultivation energy/magic glow) radiates powerfully from her hands and the dough. The setting is a cozy, circular, rustic yet ornate Chinese fantasy kitchen/apothecary, featuring dark wooden walls, multiple round windows, and hanging paper lanterns. In the background, a massive, intricately carved stone oven/fireplace blazes warmly. Scrolls/talismans with ancient calligraphy float gently in the air. Shelves are stocked with exotic herbs, glowing ingredients, and vibrant pink lotus flowers bloom around the stone structure. A small, adorable six-tailed fox (huli jing) rests peacefully beside the hearth. Soft, warm volumetric lighting, depth of field, ethereal atmosphere.",
