  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed, intricate illustration, Fantasy Xianxia style, 16:9 aspect ratio. A handsome male street vendor wearing elaborate dark blue Hanfu robes with flowing ribbons and a conical straw hat (douli), standing under a traditional Chinese market stall on a heavy rainy night. He is grilling golden corn cobs over a brazier fueled by ethereal, glowing azure blue flames mixed with bright orange cooking fire. The wet cobblestone street reflects the lantern light and the magical fire. In the background, a busy night market street leads toward towering, mystical Xianxia architecture, including multi-tiered pagodas and ancient bridges shrouded in mist and rain. Dramatic volumetric lighting, cinematic atmosphere.",
