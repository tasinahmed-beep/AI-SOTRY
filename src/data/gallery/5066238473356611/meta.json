  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), ultra-detailed, photorealistic action shot of a professional mountain biker aggressively racing down a challenging, rooted dirt trail, low angle view. The male biker wears vibrant orange and blue gear, a full-face helmet, and goggles, kicking up a dramatic dust cloud behind the rear tire. The setting is a dense, lush temperate rainforest with mossy trees and ferns. Intense cinematic sunlight beams (god rays) pierce through the canopy, strongly backlighting the scene and highlighting the swirling dust particles. Dynamic motion, sharp focus on the cyclist and the high-end full-suspension bike. Professional sports photography, 16:9 aspect ratio.",
