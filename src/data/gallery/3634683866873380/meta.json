The middle-aged vendor is smiling warmly while turning the corn on a hot charcoal grill. Warm illumination from the stall contrasts sharply with the cool, dark blue rain-soaked urban street. Blurred background featuring neon signs (Ramen shop) and people walking with black umbrellas. Cinematic lighting, volumetric fog, high detail, volumetric rain.",
