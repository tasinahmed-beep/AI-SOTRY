  "prompt": "(Masterpiece), highly detailed illustration, 9:16 aspect ratio, Fantasy Xianxia style. A powerful immortal cultivator wearing flowing emerald green and gold robes stands dramatically on a craggy floating mountain cliff edge at sunrise. He is casting a fishing line (glowing with spiritual energy) into a vast, swirling golden sea of luminous clouds below. In the background, majestic floating islands hold ancient Chinese pagodas and cherry blossom trees. A majestic, ethereal water dragon spirit is coiled around a high, jagged peak. Luminous, ghost-like spirit fish swim near the base of the cliff. Dramatic lighting, epic scale, vibrant colors, cinematic quality, Wuxia inspiration.",
