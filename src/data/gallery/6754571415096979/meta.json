A handsome young man with dark blue hair and a modern white hoodie stands dynamically on a mossy rock outcrop, casting a fishing rod high over a tranquil mountain lake at sunrise.

Pastel pink and orange clouds fill the dawn sky. Traditional Japanese minka houses are nestled near the water's edge. Detailed environmental shading, vibrant colors, volumetric light.",
