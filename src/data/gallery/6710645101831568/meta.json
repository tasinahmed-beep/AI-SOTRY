  "prompt": "(Masterpiece), highly detailed illustration, 16:9 aspect ratio, full view, Modern Anime style. A futuristic caravan of nomadic adventurers traversing vast red sand dunes on an alien planet during a dramatic sunset. The vehicles are large, quadrupedal mecha-beasts resembling robotic rhinoceroses or dogs, with glowing blue eyes and weathered metal bodies. The lead mech carries two riders, one with vibrant blue hair holding a staff topped with a glowing blue orb. Smaller mecha-vehicles follow in a line, kicking up dust. The sky displays vibrant hues of orange, red, and purple, dominated by a massive, ringed planet in the upper right background. Crisp clean line art, studio quality, cinematic lighting, epic scale.",
