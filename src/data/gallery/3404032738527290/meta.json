  "prompt": "(masterpiece), photorealistic, highly detailed professional action photograph, 9:16 aspect ratio. A professional snowboarder wearing a red and black jacket executes a massive, dramatic cliff jump off a rugged, snowy mountain peak. Intense snow powder spray captures the motion. Dynamic perspective emphasizing the extreme height, looking down into a vast, snow-covered valley featuring a winding river and dense pine forest below. Steep, jagged, snow-capped mountain range in the background. Taken during the golden hour (warm sunset light), strong directional lighting highlighting textures and contrast.",
