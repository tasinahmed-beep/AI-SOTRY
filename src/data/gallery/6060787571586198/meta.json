  "prompt": "(masterpiece), best quality, highly detailed, dramatic composition, an epic scene of a determined mountain biker racing aggressively down a dynamic dirt forest trail, framed by ancient, gnarled tree roots forming a natural archway. In the background, majestic, towering Chinese Karst mountains rise into the misty sky, topped with traditional Chinese temples (pagodas). A huge, majestic golden celestial Chinese dragon flies dynamically alongside the peaks, generating wind and mist. Falling cherry blossom petals swirl around the biker. Cinematic lighting, vibrant colors, 9:16 vertical orientation, distinct Donghua Chinese animation illustration style, dynamic action.",
