  "title": "Lightning Rider in the Neon Storm",
  "prompt": "(masterpiece), (best quality), highly detailed, Comic Book Art Style, 9:16 aspect ratio. A lone cyclist wearing a dark, aerodynamic suit aggressively rides a road bike down a wet, rainy street at night. Dynamic low-angle perspective, emphasizing the high speed and water splashing from the wheels. The scene is set in a sprawling Asian metropolis (like Tokyo or Neo-Kyoto), flanked by towering skyscrapers illuminated by vibrant neon signs and complex Japanese characters (kanji/kana). Intense thunderstorm, powerful lightning bolt visible splitting the dark sky. Strong reflections of colored neon on the flooded asphalt. Include classic comic elements: dramatic lighting, action lines, speed lines, a sound effect 'WHOOOSH!', and a speech bubble with dialogue: 'The downpour won't stop me!'. Detailed line work, bold ink, color halftone printing effect.",
